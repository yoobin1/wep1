  I will always remember
The day you kissed my lipsLight as a feather
And it went just like thisNo, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002We were only eleven
But acting like grownupsLike we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cupsSinging love is forever and ever
Well, I guess that was true
